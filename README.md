# MyOnion.fun Smart Contract Documentation

## üìú Overview

MyOnion.fun utilizes two primary smart contracts to power its decentralized token and trading ecosystem:

1. **OnionRouter**: Manages token swaps, ownership changes, and migration functionality.
2. **TokenLauncher**: Handles token creation, bonding curves, metadata updates, and decentralized exchange (DEX) pair creation.

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the events and methods for each contract to facilitate seamless integration and development.
